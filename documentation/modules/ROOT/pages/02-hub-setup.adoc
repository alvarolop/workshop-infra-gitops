= 2. Deploy Argo Hub Setup
include::_attributes.adoc[]

[#laboverview]
== 2.1 Lab overview

In this workshop we are covering a GitOps infrastructure configuration approach. We will set an argo of argos and app-of-apps architecture to manage setup on destination clusters, and will apply day 2 operations on managed clusters.

_Argo Hub_ is a common OpenShift cluster for every user in this workshop that will be used for deploying the basic infrastructure on managed clusters using https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/application-set/[ApplicationSet]. Managed clusters are a set of Single Node OpenShift, alias _SNO_, available for every user and day 2 operations will setup based on ArgoCD instance running on managed cluster.

NOTE: You will be able to connect to both _Argo Hub_ and _managed_ clusters.

Take a look at the general overview of the lab. 

.Laboratory overview

First of all, when you install GitOps operator, it will deploy a default argo instance which is intended for cluster configuration. So in this instance you will find an Application _gitops-setup_ which is deploying and managing a second argocd instance and its configuration.

.Argo Hub instances

As an user lab, you will access the second argo instance where you will have privileges enough thanks to _RBAC_ configuration to deploy an https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/[Application] for applying ApplicationSet to apply configuration on your managed cluster. In this instance you can expect two ApplicationSet: _gitops-setup_ and _bootstrap-sno_.

.Argo Hub ApplicationSet

_gitops-setup_ ApplicationSet will install the _openshift-gitops_ operator and the _argocd-infra_ instance, while the second one will generate _'N'_ Applications on managed clusters for bootrstrapping the _argocd-apps_ instance and setup its configuration.

Once GitOps is deployed on your managed cluster you can start configuring day 2 operations locally in your new provisioned _argocd-infra_ instace.

[#environment]
== 2.2 Environment

You have access to two clusters: *_Argo Hub_* and your own *_SNO_*.

NOTE: Learn more about *https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/meet-single-node-openshift-our-smallest-openshift-footprint-edge-architectures[Sigle Node OpenShift]*, our managed cluster in this workshop. 

LetÂ´s start log in to *_Argo Hub_* cluster:

IMPORTANT: Replace *_<name>_* for your assigned cluster in this workshop. *_<pass>_* and *_<ocp-hub-cluster-api>_* provided by the instructor at the beginning of this workshop. 

[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source, shell,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc login -u userXX -p <pass> <ocp-hub-cluster-api>
----

It is possible to log in as well trough the web console, we recommend to do it because this way you will be able to jump between _Argo Hub_ and _SNO_ clusters easily.

IMPORTANT: Change _<domain>_ information, provided by the instructor at the beginning of this workshop.

- Open <hub-ocp-cluster-console> (E.g. https://console-openshift-console.apps.argo-hub.<domain>.opentlc.com/)
- Hit *Workshop Users*. 

.Argo Hub log in
image::hub-login-1.png[]

- Insert _userXX_ and _<pass>_ provided by instructor and click *_Log in_* button.

On top of that, once logged into _Argo Hub_ you will only have permissions over your project and destination cluster.

The reason why _Argo Hub_ has permissions over your managed cluster is because it is configured as a destination server, given an authentication method.

In _Argo Hub_ there is a secret in _openshift-operators_ namespace for every managed cluster containing this information. There are several ways to implement this, you can generate an 
authentication token for this purpose or you can pass _kubeconfig_ file to give full control over the destination cluster. You do not need to do anything as this is already done
on hub-setup Application.

You can take a look to the chart used for creating these secrets https://github.com/alvarolop/workshop-gitops-infra-deploy/blob/main/02-gitops-setup/values.yaml[here] and https://github.com/alvarolop/workshop-gitops-infra-deploy/blob/main/02-gitops-setup/templates/secret-cluster.yaml#L25-L26[here].

[#hubsetup]
== 2.3 Argo Hub Setup

In the _Argo Hub_ cluster you can find two argo instances, _openshift-gitops_ (default) and _argocd_. Default instance is intended to manage the hub itself, and it is in charge of
deploying the _argocd_ instance and its configuration. While _argocd_ instance is dedicated for managed clusters setup and configuration.

_Argo Hub_ setup should be done only once before this workshop, you can log in to _openshift-gitops_ instance console.

IMPORTANT: Change _<domain>_ information, provided by the instructor at the beginning of this workshop.

- Open <openshift-gitops-instance-console> (E.g. https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.apps.argo-hub.<domain>.opentlc.com)
- Click *_LOG IN VIA OPENSHIFT_*.

- Hit *Workshop Users*.

- Insert _userXX_ and _<pass>_ provided by instructor and click *_Log in_* button.

.openshift-gitops instance log in
image::hub-login-2.png[]

This user has _view permissions_ in _openshift-gitops_ instance, you can take a look to the objects argo is managing for deploying the second instance.

.hub-setup overview
image::hub-setup-overview.png[]

Then you can go to the code to take a look to the helm charts used.

IMPORTANT: As this configuration is already deployed you do not need to make any change, only observe the way it was done.

- Go to your _workshop-gitops-content-deploy_ repository, navigate to the _hub-setup_ Application code and see how this sets up env configuration on _in-cluster_ (https://kubernetes.default.svc):

[.lines_7]

      selfHeal: true
----

Check the _openshift-gitops_ console and take a look to the objects managed by argo in the _hub-setup_ Application. As you can see, using range of values while rendering charts allows to create charts for multiple destinations without much complexity.

.hub-setup Application in openshift-gitops instance console

For this initial setup it is only required to create _argocd_ instance, _App Projects_, _Groups_, _Role Bindings_ and _Secrets_ for cluster destinations.

Then once this second instance, _argocd_, is up and running, you can login to the argo console with your *_userXX_*:

IMPORTANT: Change _<domain>_ information, provided by the instructor at the beginning of this workshop.

- Open <argocd-instance-console> (E.g. https://argocd-server-openshift-operators.apps.argo-hub.<domain>.opentlc.com)
- Click *_LOG IN VIA OPENSHIFT_*.

.Log in argocd console instance

- Hit *Workshop Users*. 

.OpenShift credentials for argocd instance
image::hub-login-1.png[]

- Insert user _userXX_ and _<pass>_ provided by instructor and click *_Log in_* button.

.argocd instance log in
image::hub-login-2.png[]

In this instance ,_argocd_, you will log in to the console as *_admin user_* of your own project while you will only have *_cluster reader_* permissions when you login to OpenShift _Argo Hub_ console.

By using _argocd_ instance you will be able to setup your own managed cluster.

NOTE: Ideally you could set up every managed with a single ApplicationSet by configuring multiple cluster-definition. However because of the workshop structure you need to perform cluster scoped configurations without affecting other users, but your repository could be easily adapted to perform actions on multiple clusters.
